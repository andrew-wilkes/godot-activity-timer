The best icon sizes seem to be:

200 x 200 for large buttons up to 5 horizontally.
100 x 100 for the minimum easily clickable.

Group the icons in Inkscape and export to icons.png with dimensions to give the desired per-icon size.

Use Imagemagick via the convert function.

convert -crop 16.6666%x20% icons.png icon.png

This splits the image into individual images with numerical imcrements appended to the name.

icon-0.png etc.

Then drag and drop the icon images to the button texture slots.

When adding more icons:

* export all to a temp folder below the assets/icons folder.
* run the convert utility with appropriate % settings
* copy the new icoms to the assets/icons folder
* delete the temp folder
