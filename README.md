# Activity Timer Created with the Godot Engine

This will be a mobile App.

Click a plus button to create a new timer.

The time increments will be in minutes with the stop time rounded to the nearest minute by default.

The timer is given a name by the user.

The timers may be listed with a summary of their current time counts and status of running, or stopped.

Instead of a reset function: have an edit function. It should not be easy to accidentally reset a timer. And editing allows for adjustment of the time value in case of say forgetting it was left running.

Maybe have an alert every hour of the running timer's status?

Have a *save* feature to save the timer data to a file.

When tapping on a timer in the list, open a scene with large *start* and *stop* buttons and a large *time* display. This avoids fumbling mistakes tapping on the small list items.

Have a bar graph stats display. Project the bars horizontally so that the names may easily be easily superimposed on them.

Produce stats that may be useful to show trends of motivation etc.
